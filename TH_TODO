These are the bugs from Test::Harness as of March 18, 2007.  The "[ ]" box
should be checked off as we verify that each one is no longer an issue for
THC.  Feel free to add notes for each one, if needed.

Legend:

 [ ] - open issue (may be fixed, but research is needed)
 [*] - fixed
 [-] - not applicable (e.g., anything to do with Test::Harness::Straps)
 [!] - wont fix

Need investigation:

- [ ] 12458   Set HARNESS_IS_VERBOSE when in verbose mode.    new Wishlist 1
  years ago     
  Note:  I don't think is an issue for THC, but I could be mistaken.
- [ ] 9589    Allow prove to run tests in the perl debugger   new Wishlist 2

- [ ] 8596    Obtain failed test information when runtests is done    new
  Wishlist 2 years ago     
  Note:  working on this now.

  new Wishlist 3 years ago     

Fixed:

- [*] 14767   Can't locate Devel/Cover.pm in @INC during runtests()   new
  1 years ago
  Note: The person who raised the ticket wanted PERL5OPT to be
        cleared. Instead we propagate the test's libs into its
        children by setting PERL5LIB. This doesn't have the same
        effect but it does remove the failure due to PERL5OPT pointing
        to an unloadable module.
- [*] 17210   prove -b and prove -l should set PERL5LIB   new Important 1

        works fine on a recent Cygwin.

  1 years ago     
  Note: We still have this problem with TAP::Harness::Compatible but
        new applications should use TAP::Harness which will shortly
        allow view delegates to be plugged which pretty much solves
        this problem.
