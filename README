TAP-Parser 2.99_1

TAP::Parser is designed as a replacement for Test::Harness. It is hoped
that it will become Test::Harness 3.0.

INSTALLATION

To install TAP::Parser using ExtUtils::MakeMaker do:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

To use Module::Build do:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

If you elect to install the "runtests" program (you are prompted during
perl {Makefile,Build}.PL) you will be able to run your tests against
TAP::Parser from your modules home directory by running

    runtests -rb

See runtests --help for more information.
